## What is NeoMood?

NeoMood is a modern Neovim configuration that makes editing faster and more intuitive. Key features:

- **Leader Key**: `<Space>` (your main command key)
- **Flash Jump**: Press `s` to jump anywhere on screen
- **Smart Features**: Auto-completion, syntax highlighting, file explorer

## Getting Started

**Important**: This tutorial teaches you to use NeoMood. The most important thing to remember is that pressing `<ESC>` will always get you out of trouble.

## Understanding Neovim's Core Principles

Neovim follows a simple but powerful grammar system that makes it incredibly efficient once you understand the pattern.

### The Neovim Grammar: [COUNT] + ACTION + MOVEMENT

Neovim commands follow this structure:
- **COUNT** (optional): How many times to repeat
- **ACTION**: What to do (delete, change, yank, etc.)
- **MOVEMENT**: Where to operate (word, line, character, etc.)

### Basic Actions
```
d - delete
c - change (delete and enter insert mode)
y - yank (copy)
v - visual select
```

### Basic Movements
```
w - word forward
b - word backward
e - end of word
$ - end of line
0 - beginning of line
j - down one line
k - up one line
```

### Examples of the Grammar in Action

**Movement with Count:**
- `3w` - move 3 words forward
- `5j` - move 5 lines down
- `2b` - move 2 words backward

**Action + Movement:**
- `dw` - delete word
- `cw` - change word
- `y$` - yank to end of line
- `d0` - delete to beginning of line

**Count + Action + Movement:**
- `3dw` - delete 3 words
- `2cw` - change 2 words
- `5dd` - delete 5 lines
- `3yy` - yank 3 lines

### Why This Grammar is Powerful

Once you learn this pattern, you can combine any count, action, and movement:
- `d3w` - delete 3 words forward
- `c2j` - change 2 lines down
- `y5k` - yank 5 lines up
- `v3e` - visually select 3 words to the end

### Special Cases

Some commands work alone:
- `dd` - delete entire line
- `yy` - yank entire line
- `cc` - change entire line
- `x` - delete character under cursor

This grammar makes Neovim incredibly expressive and efficient!

  5. Move to the third line.

  6. Type "cyy to copy the line to register 'c'.

  7. Now paste them in reverse order: type "cp, then "bp, then "ap.

---> First line goes to register a
---> Second line goes to register b  
---> Third line goes to register c

### Lesson 9.5: COPY AND PASTE WITH TEXT OBJECTS

** Combine copy with text objects for efficient copying. **

  1. Move to the line below marked --->.

  2. Put cursor inside the quotes around "copy this text".

  3. Type yi" to copy inside the quotes.

  4. Move to the end of the line and type p to paste.

  5. Put cursor inside the parentheses around "and this too".

  6. Type ya( to copy around the parentheses (including parentheses).

  7. Move to a new position and paste with p.

---> The message says "copy this text" and also (and this too) for practice

  8. Put cursor on the word "function" below.

  9. Type yiw to copy the inner word.

  10. Move to the end and paste with p.

  11. Put cursor on "complete" and type yaw to copy around the word (includes spaces).

  12. Paste with p in a new position.

---> This function should complete the copy practice exercises

### Lesson 9.6: COPY TO SYSTEM CLIPBOARD

** Use "+ to access system clipboard. **

  1. Move to the line below marked --->.

  2. Type "+yy to copy the line to system clipboard.

  3. You can now paste this line in any other application (outside Neovim).

  4. Type "+p to paste from system clipboard.

---> This text will be copied to your system clipboard

### Lesson 9.7: COPY AND PASTE PRACTICE

** Practice different copy and paste combinations. **

Practice text for copy and paste exercises:

---> Line 1: Quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog
---> Line 2: The "quoted text" and (parenthesized text) need copying  
---> Line 3: function_name variable_name method_call()
---> Line 4: Copy this {entire block} and [these brackets] too
---> Line 5: Final practice line with words to copy

**Exercise checklist:**
1. Copy Line 1 with yy and paste it after Line 5
2. Copy just "quoted text" (including quotes) from Line 2 
3. Copy the word "function_name" from Line 3
4. Copy from "Copy" to "brackets" in Line 4 using visual selection
5. Copy Line 5 to register 'x' using "xyy
6. Copy any line to system clipboard using "+yy
7. Paste from register 'x' using "xp
8. Copy two words at once using y2w
9. Copy to end of line using y$
10. Copy entire paragraph using visual line mode (V)

NOTE: Remember - y copies, p pastes after cursor, P pastes before cursor!

## Working with Indentation

### The Power of `vij`

`vij` is a magical command that selects all lines at the same indentation level:

```
vi{  - Select inside braces
vij  - Select same indentation level
vaI  - Select around indentation (with blank lines)
```

### Indentation Practice

**Using the function block in your practice text:**

1. **Select indentation block**: Put cursor on `line1_here` and press `vij`
2. **Select with braces**: Put cursor inside the `if (condition)` block and press `vi{`
3. **Move selection**: In visual mode, press `J` to move lines down, `K` to move up
4. **Indent selection**: Select lines with `V`, then press `>` to indent, `<` to outdent

**Try these specific exercises:**
- Put cursor on `line1_here` and press `vij` to select the indented block
- Put cursor inside `{` after `if (condition)` and press `vi{` to select everything inside braces
- Select the three lines with `line1_here`, `line2_here`, `line3_here` and press `>` to indent them more
- Select the same lines and press `<` to outdent them

**Pro tip**: After selecting with `vij`, you can:
- Press `>` to indent the whole block
- Press `<` to outdent the whole block
- Press `J` to move the whole block down
- Press `K` to move the whole block up

## Editing Text

### Entering Insert Mode
```
i - Insert before cursor
I - Insert at beginning of line
a - Insert after cursor
A - Insert at end of line
o - New line below
O - New line above
```

### Deleting Text
```
x - Delete character (no yank)
dd - Delete line
dw - Delete word
d$ - Delete to end of line
```

### Changing Text
```
cw - Change word
cc - Change line
c$ - Change to end of line
r  - Replace single character
```

### Editing Practice

**Fix the mistakes in your practice text:**

1. **Fix spelling errors**:
   - Put cursor on "textt" (line 1) and press `x` to delete extra 't'
   - Put cursor on "quikc" (line 2) and press `cw` then type "quick"
   - Put cursor on "hass" (line 3) and press `x` to delete extra 's'  
   - Put cursor on "mispelled" (line 4) and press `cw` then type "misspelled"

2. **Insert variations**:
   - Put cursor at end of line 1 and press `A` to append text
   - Put cursor anywhere on line 2 and press `o` to create new line below
   - Put cursor anywhere on line 3 and press `O` to create new line above

3. **Delete variations**:
   - Put cursor on any character and press `x` to delete it
   - Put cursor on line 7 and press `dd` to delete entire line
   - Put cursor on "mistakes" and press `dw` to delete word

4. **Copy and paste**:
   - Put cursor on "This is line one" and press `yy` to copy line
   - Move to end of file and press `p` to paste after cursor
   - Put cursor on "practice" and press `yw` to copy word
   - Move somewhere else and press `p` to paste word

5. **Undo/Redo**:
   - Press `u` to undo your last change
